# dst-receipt-expense

## Project Description

The rapid proliferation of digital devices and the widespread adoption of e-commerce platforms have resulted in an exponential increase in the creation of financial documents, such as receipts and invoices. These documents, integral to tracking and managing financial transactions, have traditionally required manual review for categorization and analysis. However, manually sorting through receipts and invoices to extract relevant data can be highly time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. Consequently, there is a growing need for automated solutions that can streamline this process, providing more accurate and efficient methods of categorizing financial information. The primary objective of this project is to develop an intelligent, automated system capable of accurately classifying expenses using images of receipts and invoices, which will ultimately contribute to more effective financial management and decision-making.
